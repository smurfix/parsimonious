 ============
 Parsimonious
 ============
 .
 Parsimonious aims to be the fastest arbitrary-lookahead parser written in pure
 Python—and the most usable. It's based on parsing expression grammars (PEGs),
 which means you feed it a simplified sort of EBNF notation. Parsimonious was
 designed to undergird a MediaWiki parser that wouldn't take 5 seconds or a GB
 of RAM to do one page, but it's applicable to all sorts of languages.

 Goals
 =====
 .
 * Speed
 * Frugal RAM use
 * Minimalistic, understandable, idiomatic Python code
 * Readable grammars
 * Extensible grammars
 * Complete test coverage
